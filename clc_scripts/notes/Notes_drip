I had these issues with drip.

1. After the first run the output would disappear and the times were suspiciously
   slow, as though the translator were never executing, but there was no log or
   other output of any problem. 
  
   There is this bug trace:
   https://github.com/ninjudd/drip/issues/44
   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/logstash-users/ltBCuh2wemU
   This problem went away outside of python env. One report above says
   if you don't redirect input you can avoid the drip bug. 

2. After killing a couple of runs I had 3 'drip_proxy' running and they 
   took up 100% of cpu.

3. After working around these problems I couldn't find an improvement:

   Report on cloud compiler performance 11.24.14
   Test with 1 worker, no network transfer, run pollen.jar only, instance type
   t2.small, 2GB RAM$

   WITH DRIP: LOAD=5, CLIENT average elapsed sec:    1.11 
   NO DRIP:   LOAD=5, CLIENT average elapsed sec:    1.04
