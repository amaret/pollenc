config.js:
  host in config.js had to be control.amaret.com not localhost.

timezone:
  I could not bring it up I got the message that the timezones could be off. 
  The issue is that my mac and control.amaret.com are in different tz which 
  confuses time based queries.
  There are various posts on this.

  There is a timezone config parameter for
  config.js but its only documented usage is for graphite:

  I had to do two things:
    set grafana in the browser to use UTZ (greenwich mean time).
    set my mac to UTZ. 
  Now it works.
    
Series names: 
  The series names are created in riemann.config.
  It is <host>.<service>:
      ; influxdb series
        (fn [event]
            (let [series (format "%s.%s" (:host event) (:service event))]
                (influx series {
                    :time  (:time event)
                    :value (:metric event)
                })
            )
        )
